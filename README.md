# NoChatHide
A mod that prevents the chat from getting cleared when you reload a world

# (WHY IS THIS MOD A MESS)
TLDR; i litterally CANNOT find a SINGLE Proper mixin to just pop a chat GUI and be done with it. It HAS to be a mixin that gets sent constantly or smth. Hence why the working mixin is litterally "NetworkManager"
